## **Introduction**

This MERN stack booking app is a full-stack web application that provides a user-friendly interface for booking appointments or reservations. It utilizes the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing user and booking data.
- **Express.js**: A Node.js framework for building the backend API.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.

## **Prerequisites**

Before you start working with this application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm
- MongoDB
- Git
- Code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

## **Getting Started**

To run the MERN stack booking app on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/AjanaLarry/BookingApp.git
    cd BookingApp
    ```
    
2. Install dependencies:
    
    ```bash
    # Install backend dependencies
    cd backend
    npm install
    
    # Install frontend dependencies
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    
    ```
    
3. Start the server and client concurrently:
    
    ```bash
    # In the root directory
    npm run dev
    
    ```
    

The app should be running at **`http://localhost:3000`**.
